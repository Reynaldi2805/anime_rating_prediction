I am thrilled to present this milestone project focusing on the prediction of anime ratings, specifically tailored to meet the needs of streaming platforms and broadcasting channels. In today's competitive landscape, data-driven decision-making is paramount, and this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to enhance content selection strategies.

**Problem Statement**

Anime faces a myriad of challenges in today's dynamic entertainment industry. From fierce competition to shifting viewer preferences, understanding the factors that influence popularity is crucial for success. Questions arise: What truly drives popularity? Is it the studio behind the animation, the genre of the series, or perhaps the dedicated fanbase? These are the pressing questions that this analysis seeks to address, offering valuable insights into the key drivers of anime success.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop robust regression models capable of accurately predicting the ratings of anime series. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we seek to empower streaming platforms and broadcasting channels with predictive capabilities to optimize their content portfolios.

**Potential Users**

- Streaming Platforms and Broadcasting Channels: As key players in the entertainment industry, streaming platforms and broadcasting channels rely on engaging content to attract and retain audiences. By integrating our predictive models into their decision-making processes, these platforms can strategically curate their anime offerings, leading to improved viewer engagement, retention, and ultimately, business growth.

- Manga/Manhwa Artists: For manga and manhwa artists looking to transition their artwork into animated content, our analysis offers invaluable insights. By setting KPIs focused on audience engagement metrics such as the number of members adding their animations to their watchlists and favorites within the HuggingFace application, artists can gauge the potential popularity and reception of their creations, guiding their content development and marketing strategies.

We are excited about the possibilities that this analysis presents and look forward to collaborating with stakeholders to unlock the full potential of anime content selection.
